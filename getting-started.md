## Welcome to your Rotki App: The portfolio manager that protects your privacy

Now you can:

- Visit your Rotki **dashboard**: **[rotki.dappnode](http://rotki.dappnode/)**.
- Rotki must have access to a synchronized Mainnet Ethereum node. You must have an Execution client (Besu, Erigon, Geth, or Nethermind) and Consensus client (Prysm, Teku, Lighthouse, or Nimbus) installed, and fully synced. 
- You can configure this from the [Repository Tab](http://my.dappnode/#/repository/eth) or directly from the [StakersUI](http://my.dappnode/#/stakers/)
- You can find in the Rotki documentation the information on the different nodes you can use [Rotki](https://rotki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage_guide.html#rpc-nodes)
- Explore the [Rotki documentation](https://rotki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage_guide.html) for more information about what can you do with Rotki.
